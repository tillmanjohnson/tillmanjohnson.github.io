    <div class='abtme2'>HELLO! My name is Tillman Johnson, welcome to my training website. 
      Ever since I was a kid I have loved playing basketball. Fortunately, I've been surrounded by 
    so many wonderful coaches that have taught me so much. Now that my playing days are over, my new
    found passion is to teach others all the amazing things I have learned through my years playing this
    sport. My main goal is to help other kids reach their full potential and achieve thier goals!</div>

     <div class='inspo-aflex'>
       <div class='inspo-a1'>Stephen Curry: He is the first player that I really fell in love with. He is a special talent.
       A lot of his fundementals I try and replicate and teach to those I train. Mainly his footwork and shooting form. There
       is so much of his game that I implement into my training.</div>
       <div class='inspo-a2'>Demar Derozan: What I love about Demar is his mid-range game. He is so efficient and knows how to get 
       to his spots. That is one thing I teach those I train, learn where you shoot the ball best from and obtain the ability
       to get to those spots time and time again.</div>
       <div class='inspo-a3'>Kevin Durant: Much is the same with Kevin Durant. One of the best players of all time.
       One thing I admire about his game is his pace. He always plays at his speed, never getting sped up. Always in control 
       and knows how to control a game. This also, is something I teach.</div>
